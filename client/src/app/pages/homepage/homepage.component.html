            Every corner of the apartment or room will be inspected and, best of all, this will all be
            documented in a video tour made available on the apartment listing. Multiple high-definition
            photographs will also be available for you to see on the website. So there’s no need for a

            hours, you will only receive a partial refund and will be charged a booking fee (30% of the first

            way it appeared in the video tour, and you have pictures and evidence to prove this, you will be

          <p>Yes, this is absolutely possible. The minimum stay for tenants in Barcelona is 31 days. Apart

          <p>As a tenant, you will be charged an initial payment of 30% of your first month's rent. Our
            market research shows that this is a very fair and reasonable fee. We understand that it is
            already costly to move into a flat as landlords usually request at least a 2 month deposit,
            plus deposit for utilities; and then there is the agency fee (usually an additional month).
            That's why we charge the lowest possible fee for our unmatched services to make things easy for
            you.</p>
