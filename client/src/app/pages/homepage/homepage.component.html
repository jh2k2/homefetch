          <p>At Home Fetch, we send a qualified member of our team to visit the property on your behalf.
            They will do the exact same things that you would do if you were to visit the property yourself.
            Every corner of the apartment or room will be inspected and, best of all, this will all be
            documented in a video tour made available on the apartment listing. Multiple high-definition
            photographs will also be available for you to see on the website. So there’s no need for a
            physical visit – we’ve done it all for you! Don’t worry, we can assure you that you will not be

          <p>You have the right to cancel your booking free of charge up to 48 hours after booking. After 48
            hours, you will only receive a partial refund and will be charged a booking fee (30% of the first
            month's rent). If you have already moved in and you genuinely find that the property is not the
            way it appeared in the video tour, and you have pictures and evidence to prove this, you will be
            eligible for a full refund. In fact, we will be more than happy to assist you with finding a new

            I need a place to stay for only 1 month. Is this possible?

          </summary>
          <p>Yes, this is absolutely possible. The minimum stay for tenants in Barcelona is 31 days. Apart
            from “tourist households,” the law in Barcelona prohibits short-term rental occupancies of under
            a full month. </p>

            Is there a charge for using your services?

          </summary>
          <p>As a tenant, you will be charged an initial payment of 30% of your first month's rent. Our
            market research shows that this is a very fair and reasonable fee. We understand that it is
            already costly to move into a flat as landlords usually request at least a 2 month deposit,
            plus deposit for utilities; and then there is the agency fee (usually an additional month).
            That's why we charge the lowest possible fee for our unmatched services to make things easy for
            you.</p>
